# Hanna-Hinn-NodeJS
Backend NodeJS Project

** Note: nodemon is added on npm start script in package.json

Create a NodeJS server that will handle the requests and do:
* Create a text file if not exist called requests.txt in the project root (update it if it exists).
* In each request, add a new line to the request's file containing the time and URL of the request.
* Use nodemon module to run the server
